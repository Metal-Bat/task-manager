## Basic Commands for local

### Starting Project

- first we can install python packages (use pyenv for better and easier response)

    ```bash
    # install pyenv for your operating system
    pyenv install 3.11.9
    pyenv virtualenv 3.11.9 tasks
    pyenv local tasks
    pyenv shell tasks
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements/local.txt
    ```

- and second install pre-commit (a tool for check your code with black , flake8, mypy, isort and ... before commit and test code before push)

    ```bash
    pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit install --hook-type pre-commit --hook-type pre-push
    ```

- To Simple Build

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f local.yml up
    ```

- To Build and Run

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f local.yml up --build
    ```

- To Build and Run in Background

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f local.yml up --build -d
    ```

- To Make Migration, use this command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django python manage.py makemigrations
    ```

- To Migration, use this command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django python manage.py migrate
    ```

- To run tests:

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django pytest
    ```

- To run tests with coverage

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django coverage run -m pytest
    docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django coverage html
    docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django open htmlcov/index.html
    ```

- To Running type checks with mypy:

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django  mypy tasks
    ```

- To create a **superuser account**, use this command:

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f local.yml run --rm django python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

## Deployment

- set traefik url base on your domain to make set ssl automatic
- create .envs/.production folder and put .envs like local there (you can use merge_production_dotenvs_in_dotenv.py)
- You will need to build the stack first. To do that, run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f production.yml build
    ```

- Once this is ready, you can run it with:

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f production.yml up
    ```

- To run the stack and detach the containers, run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f production.yml up -d
    ```

- To run a migration, open up a second terminal and run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f production.yml run --rm django python manage.py migrate
    ```

- To create a superuser, run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f production.yml run --rm django python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

- If you need a shell, run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f production.yml run --rm django python manage.py shell
    ```

- To check the logs out, run:

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f production.yml logs
    ```

- If you want to scale your application, run(donâ€™t try to scale postgres, celerybeat, or traefik.):

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f production.yml up --scale django=4
    docker-compose -f production.yml up --scale celeryworker=2
    ```

- Once you are ready with your initial setup, you want to make sure that your application is run by a process manager to survive reboots and auto restarts in case of an error. You can use the process manager you are most familiar with. All it needs to do is to run docker compose -f production.yml up in your projects root directory. (Supervisor config)

    ```text
    [program:{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}]
    command=docker compose -f production.yml up
    directory=/path/to/{{cookiecutter.project_slug}}
    redirect_stderr=true
    autostart=true
    autorestart=true
    priority=10
    ```

- Move it to /etc/supervisor/conf.d/{{project_slug}}.conf and run:

    ```text
    supervisorctl reread
    supervisorctl update
    supervisorctl start {{project_slug}}
    ```

- For status check, run:

    ```text
    supervisorctl status
    ```
